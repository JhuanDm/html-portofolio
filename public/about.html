<h1>About Me </h1>
<h3>Emerson Lake & Palmer</h3>
<p>He had white horses
  And ladies by the score
  All dressed in satin
  And waiting by the door
  
  Ooh, what a lucky man he was
  Ooh, what a lucky man he was</p>

<p>White lace and feathers
  They made up his bed
  A gold covered mattress
  On which he was laid
  
  Ooh, what a lucky man he was
  Ooh, what a lucky man he was</p>

<p>He went to fight wars
  For his country and his king
  Of his honor and his glory
  The people would sing
  
  Ooh, what a lucky man he was
  Ooh, what a lucky man he was
